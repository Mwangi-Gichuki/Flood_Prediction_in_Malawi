# Flood_Prediction_in_Malawi

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective


Group 5 is a consulting firm that was founded back in 2019: we have been tasked by the Malawian government to build a model that will be able to predict whether a flood is likely to occur or not. Among the natural disasters, floods are the most destructive, causing massive damage to human life, infrastructure, agriculture, and the socioeconomic system. Governments all over the world, therefore, are under pressure to develop reliable and accurate maps of flood risk areas and further plan for sustainable flood risk management focusing on prevention, protection, and preparedness. Flood prediction models are of significant importance for hazard assessment and extreme event management.
